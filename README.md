In Java, an ArrayList is used to represent a dynamic list. While Java arrays are fixed in size. ArrayLists allow flexibility by being able to both add and remove elements. An array is a basic data structure provided by Java. As we know itâ€™s fixed, the elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. An array is size specific, and it cannot be changed either. Accessing array elements is done using square brackets ([]). ArrayList is part of the Java Collection framework that we find in the java.util package. ArrayLists being dynamic are resizable. You can add or remove elements from an ArrayList without specifying its initial size. ArrayLists can hold elements of any data type (objects, strings, integers, etc.). To access and modify arraylists, you must use methods such as get(), add(), or remove(). Arrays and arraylist are both functions that serve the same purpose, but they have key differences. Their method of access is different, and they differ in representing their size. When declaring an array, size must be declared specifically. For arrayList, there is no need to specify their initial capacity. For memory allocation, arrays use contiguous memory allocation and arrayLists memory allocation is non-contiguous memory allocation. ArrayLists provide more flexibility, but arrays are more memory-efficient when a fixed size is sufficient. We must choose which function to use based on our requirements.
